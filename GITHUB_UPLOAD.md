## Troubleshooting

**"Git not found" error?**
- Use GitHub Desktop (Method 1) - no Git needed!
- Or install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

**Upload taking too long?**
- `node_modules` folder is huge - it's in `.gitignore` so won't upload
- Only source files upload (fast!)

**Can't find the folder?**
- It's at: `/Users/michaelplamann/powerbi-ai-builder`
- Open Finder and drag folder to GitHub Desktop

## Quick Check - What Gets Uploaded?

‚úÖ All source code (src/ folder)
‚úÖ All components and utils
‚úÖ Configuration files
‚úÖ Documentation (README, etc)
‚úÖ Sample CSV files
‚ùå node_modules (too large, auto-excluded)
‚ùå Build output (dist/ folder)
